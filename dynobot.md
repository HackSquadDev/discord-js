#dynobot

-If you’ve just set up your Discord server, Dyno should most likely be the very first bot you install on the same to upgrade its capabilities.
-It’s a feature-rich bot that gives you total control over its features using a dedicated dashboard, including auto moderation with Mod log, timed mutes and bans. It has also been updated to detect mass-mention or raid spam in your community chats.
-Dyno is also useful for airing custom announcements, especially when someone joins, leaves or is banned from the server. It can also assign roles to users and post AFK statuses on your behalf.
-However, what I like even more is the fact that it comes with Cleverbot integration and can be used to post Overwatch stats, Google results but most importantly stream music from YouTube.
